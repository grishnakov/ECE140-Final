    Our AI-powered assistant offers personalized outfit recommendations based on weather and sensor data. With secure authentication, real-time monitoring, and predictive insights, we make wardrobe management smarter and more convenient.</p>
    <h2>THE TEAM</h2>
    <p>Our team consists of two dedicated developers with a wide range of experience spanning front and back end development and deployment, as well as integration of IoT devices.</p>
