    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
    <p>Weâ€™re building a smart IoT wardrobe management app that connects with ESP32 environmental sensors to provide real-time temperature and humidity insights. Users can securely log in, manage their devices, and track environmental trends through an interactive dashboard.
    <br> <br>
    Our AI-powered assistant offers personalized outfit recommendations based on weather and sensor data. With secure authentication, real-time monitoring, and predictive insights, we make wardrobe management smarter and more convenient.</p>
    <h2>THE TEAM</h2>
    <p>Our team consists of two dedicated developers with a wide range of experience spanning front and back end development and deployment, as well as integration of IoT devices.</p>
